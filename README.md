# Yet Another Solarized Theme

Inspired by other solarized themes, this one uses overall muted colours, but actually keeps text readable. This theme was motivated by my experience working with an old monitor. Light themes improve working with dim monitors, but none of the themes I tried did quite fit the bill. Hope you enjoy this one ðŸŽ‰
